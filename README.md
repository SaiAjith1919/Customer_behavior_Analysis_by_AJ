# Customer_behavior_Analysis_by_AJ
I built a Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis dashboard using Python, MySQL, and Power BI.

This project is about analyzing customer shopping patterns to understand how different customer groups behave and what factors influence their purchase decisions. I worked on an end-to-end pipeline using **Python, MySQL, and Power BI** to clean the data, analyze it, and create an interactive dashboard for insights.

The dataset contains 3,900 customer transactions with details such as age, gender, purchase amount, category, subscription status, shipping type, review ratings, discounts, etc. Using Python, I performed EDA, handled missing values, created new features like **Age Group** and **Purchase Frequency**, and then loaded the cleaned data into** MySQL** for querying and business-level insights.

After running SQL queries for segmentation, product performance, revenue contribution, and customer profiles, I visualized the results in **Power BI** using **KPIs**,** bar charts, donut charts, filters, and drill-through** pages.

**Key Insights**

Young adults generate the highest revenue.

Returning customers contribute the maximum portion of sales.

Accessories and Clothing are the most purchased categories.

Subscription users make more transactions, but non-subscribers contribute more total revenue.

Express shipping customers spend more compared to standard shipping users.



**Tools Used**

Python (Pandas, Jupyter Notebook)

MySQL Workbench

Power BI Desktop

**Outcome**

This dashboard helps businesses understand customers better, target the right audience, improve marketing strategies, and increase overall revenue.
