# Customer_behavior_Analysis_by_AJ
I built a Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis dashboard using Python, MySQL, and Power BI. I cleaned and analyzed data of 3,900 customers and visualized insights like revenue by age group, customer segments, and purchase trends. This project helps understand customer patterns and make business decisions.
